## Declaring Variables with initial values.
## Using a for loop to execute a statement until the range is less then k+1.In this case the range is k+1 = 6  ##
```
ctr = 0
k = 5 


for i in range(1, k + 1):

   ctr += i  
   * this   is the shorthand for ctr = ctr + i 
   * Print the value in the variable ctr
   
print(ctr)
